beyond academia, my commitment to bridging the gap between the underprivileged and the privileged has driven my actions. following my undergraduate studies, i dedicated time to working in the mississippi delta (clarksdale, ms) with <a href = "https://peopleshores.com">peopleshores pbc</a>, where i implemented initiatives to empower marginalized communities. through workshops and training sessions, i equipped individuals with fundamental technological skills in data science, preparing them for the demands of the contemporary workforce.
