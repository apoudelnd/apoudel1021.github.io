Beyond academia, my commitment to bridging the gap between the underprivileged and the privileged has driven my actions. Following my undergraduate studies, I dedicated time to working in the Mississippi Delta (Clarksdale, MS) with <a href = "https://peopleshores.com">Peopleshores PBC</a>, where I implemented initiatives to empower marginalized communities. Through workshops and training sessions, I equipped individuals with fundamental technological skills in data science, preparing them for the demands of the contemporary workforce.

I earned my Bachelor's Degree from the Department of Computer and Information Science at <a href="https://www.olemiss.edu/"> The University of Mississippi</a> on December 2019.
